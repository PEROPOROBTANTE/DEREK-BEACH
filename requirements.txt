# DEREK-BEACH Requirements
# Core dependencies for the FARFAN policy analysis system

# === CORE FRAMEWORK ===
# DAG and graph operations (used by choreographer.py, teoria_cambio.py)
networkx>=2.6.0

# Numerical computing (used by modules_adapters.py, analyzer_one.py, embedding_policy.py)
numpy>=1.21.0

# Machine learning (used by Analyzer_one.py)
scikit-learn>=1.0.0

# YAML configuration (used by metadata_service.py, execution_mapping.yaml)
PyYAML>=6.0

# === PDF PROCESSING ===
# PDF extraction (used by dereck_beach.py)
PyMuPDF>=1.19.0  # Also known as 'fitz'
PyPDF2>=2.0.0

# === NLP AND EMBEDDINGS ===
# Sentence transformers for embeddings (embedding_policy.py, semantic_chunking_policy.py)
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0

# SpaCy for NLP (dereck_beach.py, causal_proccesor.py)
spacy>=3.4.0

# === DATA VALIDATION ===
# Pydantic for schema validation (dereck_beach.py)
pydantic>=1.10.0

# === DOCUMENT PROCESSING ===
# DOCX support (core_orchestrator.py)
python-docx>=0.8.11

# === TESTING (optional) ===
# Uncomment for testing
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=3.0.0

# === NOTES ===
# Some modules have fallback behavior when dependencies are missing:
# - modules_adapters.py: Falls back to stub implementation when numpy is unavailable
# - Most adapters: Log warnings but continue when optional dependencies are missing
#
# Minimum required for basic operation:
#   - networkx (choreographer)
#   - PyYAML (configuration)
#   - numpy (type hints and computations)
